                <p> Python is a cross-platform, object-oriented, high-level programming language. It is a great programming
                    language to learn for beginners as it is simple to use, even though it uses very-high level data storing
                    types, such as arrays and dictionaries. Python is written in a way that is easy to read and more compact
                    than other similar program languages. This is due to the fact that Python includes the following
                    characteristics:
                <ul>
                    <li>The high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>

                    <li>Statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>

                    <li>No variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>To create your first Python code, open your own scrachpad and write your 'Hello World' Python code:
                    <code> print('Hello World') </code>
                </p>
                <p>For this 'Hello World' code, a print() statement is followed by a string. In Python, print() is a
                    function that "prints" the argument that is held within the two parenthesis. The argument, in this case
                    a string, is contained within the () and is what will be shown on the screen after running the code. We
                    will discuss more about strings later on in this document.

            <article>
                <p>Within Python there are several different data types. I will discuss some of the most commonly used
                    within Python.
                <ul>
                    <li> Float </li>
                    <code> x = 4.73 </code>
                    <li> Integers</li>
                    <code> x = 8 </code>
                    <li> String</li>
                    <code> x = "Cat" </code>
                    <li> Boolean </li>
                    <code> x = true </code>
                    <li> List </li>
                    <code> list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] </code>
                    <li> Dictionary </li>
                    <code> dict1 = {"name": "Khan", "age": 27}</code>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>As you can see, there are variables that have data assigned to them utilizing the "=" sign. It's important
                to note that this does not mean the variable is equal to the data, but simply assigned to it. In
                Python, it is simple to reassign new data to a variable. 
                <br>
                For example, say you already assigned a variable named orange to the integer 6:
                <code>
                    orange = 6
                </code>
                But you would like to change the number orange is assigned to. You would simply reassign it by setting orange equal to the new integer (or other value):
                <code>
                    orange = 6
                    <br>
                    orange = 20
                </code>
                Now orange is assigned to 20.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Seen above, you learned that there are two types of number data types in Python:
                <ul>
                    <li> Integers</li>
                    <li> Float </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Integers are whole numbers, meaning that they are not superseded by a decimal point. In Python, an
                    integer is denoted by the word <b>int</b>.
                    Floats are numbers comprised of decimal points. Both integers and floats can be utilized with operators
                    to complete math problems.

            <article>
                <p>In Python, words as datatypes are called strings or <b>str</b>. Strings are enclosed between quotations. </p>
                <code>
                    str1 = "This is a string"
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="lists">
            <header>Lists</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is
                    the list (also called an array), which can be written as a list of comma-separated elements between square brackets. Lists are indexed by a range of numbers that begins with 0. So for example, the first element in the list will have an index of 0. Lists might contain
                    items of different types, but typically the items all have the same type.
                    <code> 
                        list_1 = [item1, item2, item3, item4]
                    </code>
                    As mentioned above, a list indexes the elements within it. In the list_1 above, the item2 is at index 1.

            <header>Dictionaries</header>
            <article>
                <p>Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary. Dictionaries are sometimes
                found in other languages as “associative arrays”. Unlike lists, which are indexed by a
                range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by <b>keys</b>, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be
                keys. A dictionary syntax is enclosed with curly brackets and its key and value pairs are separated with a colon. Each key,value pair within a dictionary is separated by a comma.
                <code>
                    dict_1 = {"key1": "orange", "key2": "apple", "key3": "banana"}
                </code>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
            <header>Loops</header>
            <article>
                <p>In Python there are two types of loops: <b>for loops</b> and <b>while loops</b>. Loops are utilized to iterate through elements such as lists or dictionaries to find a specific element within that structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                A <b>for loop</b> iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the
                sequence. The syntax for a <b>for loop</b> is below:
                <code>
                for element in list:<br>
                    print(element)
                </code>
                A for loop will stop running based on the length of the list given. For lists tend to be used for this reason, they typically have a finite end to the loop iteration. It is important to not that the for loop's <b>body</b> needs to be indented one level deeper than the for loop statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                A <b>while loop</b>, also known as an infinite loop or endless loop, is a loop that runs over and over and does not terminate. In order to prevent a while loop from iterating for eternity, a condition has to be given to the loop. In other words: a while loop runs <b>while</b> the condition runs <b>true</b>. Once the condition is no longer true, the while loop will terminate the iteration. The syntax for a while loop is below:
                <code>
                    while condition_true:
                        print("Hello, still in the loop!")
                </code>
                Here is a code snippet with actual variables to show how while loops require a condition:
                <code>
                    counter = 0<br>
                    while counter <= 5:<br>
                    print(f"Currently at number {counter}.")<br>
                    counter += 1
                </code>
                In the example above, the counter will be increased by one each time the loop runs. Once the counter integer equals 5, the while loop will terminate because the statement is no longer true. 
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
            <header>Conditionals</header>
            <article>
                <p>If statements are used in python to provide a condition to determine what next code block needs to be executed. It can be used to compare variables or to determine what to do with input. The syntax of an if statement is below:
                <code>
                    if variable == condition:<br>
                        execute this code<br>
                    elif variable == other_condition:<br>
                        execute this code<br>
                    else:<br>
                        execute this code
                </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                You may notice that there was an elif statement used instead of another if statement. An elif does the same job of an if statement, but <b>will only run if the conditional statement above does not validate as true.</b> You can have as many if and elif statements as you want, however, the first conditional should be an if statement before adding elif statements.
